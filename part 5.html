  <h3>ODILON REDON, REFLECTION, PASTEL ON PAPER</h3>
  <p>American artist and theorist James Abbot McNeill Whistler remarked, “Nature contains the elements, in color and form, of all pictures, as the keyboard contains the notes of all music. But the artist is born to pick and choose… as the musician gathers his notes, and forms his chords,until he brings forth from chaos, glorious harmony.”

Abstract Expressionist artist Joan Mitchell explained, “I paint from remembered landscapes that I carry with me – and remembered feelings of them, which of course become transformed. I could certainly never mirror nature. I would more like to paint what it leaves with me.” She also said, “Sunflowers are like people to me.”

Vincent van Gogh advised us, “Keep your love of nature, for that is the true way to learn to understand art more and more”.</p>
